Fraudulent Transaction Detection

📌 Project Overview

Financial fraud is a critical challenge in today’s digital economy. This project develops a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions for a financial company. By analyzing transaction patterns, the model distinguishes between legitimate and fraudulent activities, helping financial institutions minimize losses and improve trust.

🎯 Objectives

Build a fraud detection pipeline using real-world-like transaction data.

Perform data preprocessing & feature engineering to handle class imbalance and anomalies.

Train and evaluate multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Compare models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Provide a reproducible and scalable solution for fraud detection.

📊 Methodology

1.Data Preprocessing

  --> Handled missing values and scaled numerical features.

  --> Addressed class imbalance (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions) using SMOTE / undersampling.

  --> Performed feature selection to improve efficiency.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  --> Visualized transaction distributions, correlations, and fraud patterns.

  --> Identified skewed features and normalized where necessary.

3.Model Development

  -->Implemented baseline model (Logistic Regression).

  -->Trained Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost.

  -->Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.

4.Model Evaluation

 ->Metrics used:

  -->Accuracy

  -->Precision & Recall

  -->F1-score

  -->ROC-AUC (critical for imbalanced datasets)

Compared performance and selected best model.

🚀 Results

Best performing model: LightGBM

Achieved:

  -->High precision → fewer false fraud alerts.

  -->High recall → detected majority of actual fraud cases.

  --> ROC-AUC Score: ~ 0.95%
